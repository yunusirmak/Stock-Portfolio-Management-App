# Muni Challenge

I developed this web app for muni after applying to their internship programme. It's basically a web app for buying stocks and keeping a portfolio of it. 

Some of the features:

 - Sign Up
 - Log In
 - Custom Nav Bar
 -  Autocomplete Search Bar
 - Stock Modal
 - Real time stock prices (iexcloud API)
 - Portfolio Table (incomplete)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
